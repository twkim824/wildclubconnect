WildClub Connect

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQLi, phpMyAdmin

I created this website so that students (targest specifically at freshman who don't have much prior experience) at Northwestern can more easily look for student organizations at Northwestern.

Only Northwestern email account holders can register (a confirmation email link is sent)

Once a member, the student can filter through different organizations and look at their ratings, comments and evaluations written by students who are already members of the organization. This provides deep insight into what being a member is like prior to joining the organization.

If a student wants to create a club, they merely have to fill out a form about the details of the club (e.g category, time commitment, description etc.) and the club immediately appears on the front page of the website.
